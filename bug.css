The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```

The issue lies in understanding how the browser resolves conflicting styles.  While the `div p` selector is highly specific, it only affects paragraphs *directly* inside a `div`. If there's a paragraph nested deeper, the inheritance from the parent might unexpectedly override the specific style.
