# CSS Specificity and Inheritance Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity and inheritance.  The bug arises when dealing with nested elements and conflicting styles.  The provided CSS illustrates an unexpected outcome where a deeply nested element inherits a style that conflicts with a more specific selector.

## The Problem

The core issue stems from the way CSS resolves style conflicts based on selector specificity and the inheritance mechanism. While a highly specific selector might seem to override a less specific one, inheritance can unexpectedly cause the less specific rule to be applied if the highly specific rule does not target the nested element directly. 

## Solution

The solution involves understanding the specificity rules and inheritance, either by refactoring the HTML structure to ensure better style isolation using more specific selectors to target the deeply nested element or addressing styles through the parent elements with appropriate specificity.
