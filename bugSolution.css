To solve this issue, we need to make sure the style is applied appropriately to all cases. Here are two possible solutions:

**Solution 1 (More Specific Selector):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
div div p { /* Add a more specific selector for nested paragraphs*/
  color: green;
}
```

**Solution 2 (Explicitly Style Nested Paragraphs):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

div div p {
  color: purple; /*Add a specific color for the deeply nested paragraph*/
}
```

By adding more specific selectors or styling nested paragraphs directly, we ensure consistency across all scenarios.
